    "so the code block under else is executed, and \"You are not an adult.\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. elif Statement\n",
    ".The elif (short for \"else if\") statement allows you to check multiple conditions. \n",

    "\n",

    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    # Code to execute\n",

    "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "This loop will print each fruit in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    ".Iterating Over a Range:\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "The range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4, and the loop prints each number.\n",

    "        continue\n",
